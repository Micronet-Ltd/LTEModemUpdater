## LTE Modem Updater for A317 devices

LTE Modem Updater app

Currently will run on LTE A317 devices. This application will update devices from 20.00.34 .4, .7, and .10 to the new version for Verizon and from 20.00.552 .4 and .7 to the new version for AT&T. Before trying to update the modem firmware this application will upload logs to Dropbox and after the modem firmware has been updated it will try to upload results to Dropbox.

Note: You will need to move the Micronet A317 .keystore and .properties file into the app level folder in order for the application to build and work properly.
