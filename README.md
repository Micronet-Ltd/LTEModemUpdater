a317 Telit LTE Modem updater android app

Currently can run on A317 devices to update modem firmware versions from 20.00.032 -> 20.00.034 and 20.00.032.0-B041 -> 20.00.034. Should take 5 to 10 minutes to run. Screen will turn green if update completed successfully. Screen will turn red if update did not complete successfully. If update fails, restarting the device and trying again could help. You will need to move the Micronet A317 .keystore and .properties file into the app level folder in order for the application to work properly.
